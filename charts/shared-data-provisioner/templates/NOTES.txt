How to start:

Having a component (subdirectory) "abc" in a base directory "{{ .Values.baseDir }}"
you can create a PVC:

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-abc
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      component: abc
  accessModes:
  - ReadOnlyMany
  storageClassName: shared-data
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1M	# the size is not used at all
